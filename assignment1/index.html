      <h3>
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that caught my eye in this interactive experience is the
        large, title that’s contrasting with the background of the webpage.
      </p>

        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At one point there was this large heart-shaped button that was
        pulsating, prompting me to click on it. Upon clicking, more hearts
        appeared on the page. I spent a good few minutes clicking to see if
        there was a limit to the hearts.

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>Scrolling through the interactive experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel that it conveys the message very clearly and boldly. It balances
        engagement, information, and fun.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The interactive experience used scrolling animations to contain
        information, and at the same time allow users time to read and interact
        with each page’s contents.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel that this experience is mostly a single-time thing, although it
        is a beautiful site with impressive animations, the novelty does wear
        off after completing it.
      </p>

    <div class="Question">
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The elements in the interactive experience move as the user scrolls or
        clicks onto one of the navigation links, prompting the users to continue
        scrolling to progress until the user reaches the end.
