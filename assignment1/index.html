        <p>
          The first thing I noticed in the website is the full sized, animated
          loading screen with the text "LOADING" displayed in the center of the
          page. Upon the loading of the page, the page transforms into a
          colourful splash page with a large, contrasting title and a smaller
          subtitle to draw the attention of the viewer.

          Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main interaction of the site is scrolling. The website prompts the
          user to do that by making the elements on the site move as the viewer
          scrolls. Other interactions on the site also includes clicking of
          certain elements as some elements are deliberately clickable in order
          to add more value to the site. There is also a fair bit of reading
          involved as the site has lots of text content to back up the visuals.

        <p>
          At one point there was this large heart-shaped button that was
          pulsating, prompting me to take some form of action on it. So i
          clicked on it. Upon clicking on it, more hearts appeared on the page.
          I spent a good few minutes clicking in order to see if anything
          special happens after a certain number of clicks or if there was any
          restriction on the number of hearts.

          What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most common action was scrolling. The animations and elements on
          this webpage are all bounded together by scrolling. So most of this
          webpage is just scrolling, watching change in content, and reading,
          before resuming scrolling.

          What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the

        </h2>
        <p>
          This webpage conveys it's message of the importance and value of
          janitors in our society very well. It is a noble message that is very
          well delivered by the presentation of the webpage.

          How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The usage of bright, contrasting colours and large, bold fonts used
          for the titles assisted greatly in understanding the intentions and
          goals of this webpage. The description texts in the webpage is also
          kept deliberately short and digestable for quick reading.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I feel that this experience is mostly a single-time thing, although it
          is a beautiful site with impressive animations, the novelty does wear
          off after completing it.

        <p>
          The elements in the interactive experience move as the user scrolls or
          clicks onto one of the navigation links, prompting the users to
          continue scrolling to progress until the user reaches the end.

          The first thing that caught my eye in this interactive experience is
