            <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
            <p>At one point there was this large heart-shaped button that was
              pulsating, prompting me to click on it. Upon clicking, more hearts
              appeared on the page. I spent a good few minutes clicking to see if
              there was a limit to the hearts.</p>

            <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
              experience?</h2>
            <p>I feel that it conveys the message very clearly and boldly. It balances
              engagement, information, and fun.</p>

            <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
            <p>The interactive experience used scrolling animations to contain
              information, and at the same time allow users time to read and interact
              with each page’s contents.</p>

          <p>I feel that this experience is mostly a single-time thing, although it
            is a beautiful site with impressive animations, the novelty does wear
            off after completing it.</p>

              clicks onto one of the navigation links, prompting the users to continue
              scrolling to progress until the user reaches the end.</p>
