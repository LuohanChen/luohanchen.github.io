        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed in the website is the full sized, animated
        loading screen with the text "LOADING" displayed in the center of the
        page. Upon the loading of the page, the page transforms into a colourful
        splash page with a large, contrasting title and a smaller subtitle to
        draw the attention of the viewer.

        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The main interaction of the site is scrolling. The website prompts the
        user to do that by making the elements on the site move as the viewer
        scrolls. Other interactions on the site also includes clicking of
        certain elements as some elements are deliberately clickable in order to
        add more value to the site. There is also a fair bit of reading involved
        as the site has lots of text content to back up the visuals.

        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h2>
      <p>
        At one point there was this large heart-shaped button that was
        pulsating, prompting me to take some form of action on it. So i clicked
        on it. Upon clicking on it, more hearts appeared on the page. I spent a
        good few minutes clicking in order to see if anything special happens
        after a certain number of clicks or if there was any restriction on the
        number of hearts.

        What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most common action was scrolling. The animations and elements on
        this webpage are all bounded together by scrolling. So most of this
        webpage is just scrolling, watching change in content, and reading,
        before resuming scrolling.

    <div class="content">

        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This webpage conveys it's message of the importance and value of
        janitors in our society very well. It is a noble message that is very
        well delivered by the presentation of the webpage.
      </p>

    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="purple">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The usage of bright, contrasting colours and large, bold fonts used for
        the titles assisted greatly in understanding the intentions and goals of
        this webpage. The description texts in the webpage is also kept
        deliberately short and digestable for quick reading.

        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2>
      <p>
        I do like that that once the full context and message of the webpage is
        understood in the first viewing, it adds to the experience of
        understanding all the details, references, key historical events in
        future interactions of the webpage. However, the novelty of the fancy
        scrolling effects and clickable elements wears off quickly.

        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The elements in the page visually changes and moves around as the viewer
        scrolls down, giving the viewers a visual prompt to how much more they
        have to scroll to reach the next segment of the webpage. Once the viewer
        reaches the intended segment, the moving elements stop moving and
        textual content starts to appear, signalling to the viewer to stop
        scrolling and read the content.
      </p>

        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first element that I discovered that can be interacted with in the
        webpage would be the navigation elements on the top center of the page
        when it's first loaded in. Although it provides a quick jump to each
        section of the page, it's not very eye catching and gets overshadowed by
        the other large, colourful elements. <br /><br />The first interaction
        that caught by eye was the moving visual elements as I'm scrolling down
        the page.

        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The webpage frequently uses clippings and snippets of traditional media
        like newspapers, artwork, paper tearoffs to reinforce the site's
        aesthetics and message. The webpage presents these media pieces in a fun
        yet informative way.

        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most frustrating part of the interaction is not knowing that the
        webpage has reached it's end as there are no indicators other than the
        credits. Because the end segment looks just like every other segment on
        the webpage, I was left scrolling while anticipating more from the
        webpage.

        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction is the clickable heart. It's
        satisfying because there is seemingly no limit to how many times you can
        click the heart, it's a fun challenge to attempt to fill the screen with
        the little hearts that pops out.
